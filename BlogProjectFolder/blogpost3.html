<p>  Glass lies break easy
The shards tend to cut deep
And imbed themselves
Take root in your skin
I cut myself with lies of strength
I welcome the glass like chains
They've made a home in my skin anyways
I'm Black
And woman
So my chains have no room for imperfections
and metal can be sharp
i still sometimes find scratch marks
They have taught me
perfection
But statistics chase after me
and I’m chained in my prison</p>

<p>I thought about suicide
jump the skip
ship to another world where
maybe i could find narnia
or a key</p>

<p>Set me free
but i’m afraid to die
and it's too scary to living</p>

<p>Maybe even Narnia is this cold
Snow falls to make the veins chill
Tears have become the blood of the stone
That I use to pay
The price of this sufferance</p>

<p>I’m running from my shadow
My silhouette drinks to the destruction
I have anxiety about breathing
I’ve been set free
Why then
Do I still run from dead monsters</p>

<p>I shiver sometimes
metal gets cold</p>

<p>Metal gets old
It starts to rust
Is that why I see orange fog surrounding me clouding a mirage
Will the rust kill me?
That’d be irony
Rust is my only friend</p>
