<h2>i spoke to the ocean</h2>

  I had a conversation with the ocean today. She talked me out of fear.  Said the land been standing against her for years, mighty and headstrong, but she still wins.  She taught me the meaning of persistence.  A she lapped against the sand again and again showed me even rocks couldn’t stand the test against her, as time seemed to be only her friend.  She told me stories of how she carried war in her hands, has remembers what no eyes have seen. </p>

<p> I had a conversation with the ocean today.  She taught me how to be free.  Said that I could make even iron move out of my way.  Showed me how to flow with the wind, make friends of the sky.  Said that she kept secrets so deep inside that it would kill me to even look.  Didn’t I know she was the first to share space with the devil? Didn’t I know she was the punishment?  But  she still swayed and flew everyday, so free that Sometimes angels hold the oceans in their hands.  She must marvel even them.  That God can create something so perfect that even the tarnish of human greed, even the jealousy of his first exile, cannot destroy her beauty and vitality.  How the ocean can still be soft, incomparable.  something not even solid can be steadfast.  Even angels tend to study the ocean.  Maybe it is the way she has seen so many generations.  How she holds the screams of victims and stories untold.  Maybe the ocean takes on the pain from the souls that take rest in it.  Maybe the ocean is the matriarch of this world.  The one that births and kills and comforts and provides and holds and bares the lash of those that care nothing for consequences and still remains beautiful and still remains incomparable and still remains steadfast. </p>

<p>I had a conversation with the ocean today.  And I learned that I am her child.  I learned on this island the meaning of freedom, the meaning of strength. I abandoned fear. Learned that time was as flexible as her sister, the ocean, and that She too tended to ebb and flow with the moon.  Learned the value of a second, at peace, at the top of a mountain, the world open to possibilities.  And, just when you think that the world could not be more perfect, the next second starts.  I saw the peace in a life before i’d’ve seen as impoverished, and beauty rested in every tree, every flower, every rock that surrounds me.  I understood what was once incomprehensible.  I unbraided my tongue to fit foreign ears.  I learned what it meant to be the ocean.  I learned what it meant to be free. </p>
