    <h2>how to do your hair</h2>

      Make a playlist.  Play Beyoncé.  Play Drake.  Play Aaliyah.  Whatever you do, make sure you have some gospel so that you can be reminded, that you are the beauty of God’s image. Sing hymns because those are the notes your beauty was written in. Perfect.</p>
<p>Stand in front of the mirror.  Look yourself in the eye.  Don’t be afraid of yourself.  Look into your eyes and see the wisdom that runs through your blood so fast and it gives light to shine through the golden pools.
 admire yourself.  don’t be afraid.  Admire your strong, unyielding cheekbones and the jawline that frames the almost too small lips.  Perfect.  Admire your still wet hair, waiting for you to mold it.  It’s getting longer, convince yourself.</p>
<p>Rub conditioner through your hair and start to comb.  Be gentle with yourself.  You are delicate, despite your efforts to believe otherwise.  But unfortunately, your tender head matches your tender heart.  So lightly work your way from the outside to the roots with your light blue comb.  Don’t be disheartened by the hair that tangles its way through those wide teeth—dead things must be let go.</p>
<p>Oil your hands like the women to prayer.</p>
<p>When you are finished, you will look like a rag doll.  But gaze at the hard work put into your preparation.  Learn that preparation and patience will get you to your goal.  Always.  Perfect.</p>
<p>In the morning, untie the purple scarf and smell the sweet scent left by your conditioner.  Oil your hands again, for this is sacred, holy duty.
Tear down your hard work with a smile.  Stare in the mirror at the finished goal.</p>
<p>Your crown and glory.  Perfect.</p>
