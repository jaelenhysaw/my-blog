        I had a conversation with the ocean today. She talked me out of fear.  Said the land been standing against her for years, mighty and headstrong, but she still wins.  She taught me the meaning of persistence.  A she lapped against the sand again and again showed me even rocks couldnâ€™t stand the test against her, as time seemed to be only her friend.  She told me stories of how she carried war in her hands, has remembers what no eyes have seen....

        Glass lies break easy
        The shards tend to cut deep
        And imbed themselves
        Take root in your skin
